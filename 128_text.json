To get the sun right in your design, first decide upon your requirements for sun: make a diagram for yourself, like the key diagram, but with your own special needs. Then arrange spaces along the south, southeast, and southwest of the building to capture the sun. Take special care to detail the south edge properly, so that the sun is working indoors throughout the day. This will most often need a building which is long along the east-west axis.\n\nIf we approach the problem of indoor sunlight from the point of view of thermal considerations, we come to a similar conclusion. A long east-west axis sets up a building to keep the heat in during winter, and to keep the heat out during the summer. This makes buildings more pleasant, and cheaper to run. The \"optimum shape\" of an east-west building is given by the following table, adapted from Victor Olgyay, *Design with Climate* (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1963, p. 89). Note that it is always best to orient the long axis east-west.\n\n[DIAGRAM: A rectangular building footprint oriented east-west, labeled with \"x\" for the long axis and \"1.0\" for the short axis, with a North arrow indicating orientation]\n\n| climate | summer optimum | winter optimum | composite optimum | reasonable efficiency |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| cool (Minneapolis) | 1.4 | 1.1 | 1.1 | 1.3 |\n| [DIAGRAM: hatched rectangle, narrow] | | | | |\n| temperate (New York) | 1.63 | 1.56 | 1.6 | 2.4 |\n| [DIAGRAM: hatched rectangle, medium width] | | | | |\n| hot-arid (Phoenix) | 1.26 | none | 1.3 | 1.6 |\n| [DIAGRAM: hatched rectangle, narrow] | | | | |\n| hot-humid (Miami) | 1.7 | 2.69 | 1.7 | 3.0 |\n| [DIAGRAM: hatched rectangle, wider] | | | | |\n\n*Rough shape for different climates.*\n\n616\n\n---\n\n# 128 INDOOR SUNLIGHT\n\nTherefore:\n\n**Place the most important rooms along the south edge of the building, and spread the building out along the east-west axis.**\n\n**Fine tune the arrangement so that the proper rooms are exposed to the south-east and the south-west sun.
