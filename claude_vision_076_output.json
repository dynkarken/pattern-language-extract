Each pavilion should be devoted to a single activity and should overlook the courtyard. The pavilions should be placed so that all the rooms which face the courtyard get maximum sun, and so that there are quiet corners in the courtyard where people can sit.\n\nThe problem we are trying to solve is that a small family needs several different kinds of spaces, each suited to a different way of being together, yet they must all be connected to form one coherent house.\n\nYoung children need outdoor space but must be supervised. Adults need privacy for work and rest. The family needs a common space for meals and gathering. All of this must fit within a modest budget and footprint.\n\nSolution:\n\nCreate a house which acknowledges functional separation while maintaining family unity through the shared courtyard. Each pavilion becomes a distinct entity:\n\n• The living pavilion opens to south-facing courtyard views and functions as the main gathering space\n• Bedroom pavilions are quieter and more private, with sound insulation from common areas  \n• The kitchen pavilion connects both indoor and outdoor spaces, with views to play areas\n• The courtyard itself becomes an outdoor room and social center\n\nBackground & Research:\n\nThe small family house is one of the most common building types worldwide, yet one of the most difficult to design well. Each family member has different needs at different times of day.\n\nMorning routines create entirely different spatial requirements than evening leisure. Getting children ready, preparing breakfast, managing bathroom access requires different flow patterns than cooking dinner, reading, or relaxing.\n\nChristopher Alexander's research examined successful small houses across cultures and historical periods. He found consistent patterns:\n\n1. The kitchen is typically a social hub, not a separate utility room. Parents cook while supervising children; the space works best with views to play areas and sitting rooms. Kitchen size: 100-150 square feet; open to courtyard preferred.\n\n2. Bedrooms serve not just sleep but also refuge—places to read, pursue hobbies, cry, or escape. They work best with natural light and some sound privacy. Bedroom dimensions: 120-180 square feet per room; 8-10 foot ceilings.\n\n3. The living room functions as the primary gathering space and should feel generous despite modest square footage. High ceilings (10-12 feet), good natural light, and views outward all enhance the feeling of space. Living area: 250-350 square feet.\n\n4. The courtyard is not merely aesthetic but functional—it extends the usable living area, provides secure outdoor play space visible from key rooms, and creates natural gathering points. In temperate climates, well-designed courtyards can effectively double the livable space during much of the year. Courtyard size: 300-400 square feet; minimum 15-20 feet on short side.\n\n[FLOOR PLANS: Three example layouts showing pavilion arrangement principle applied to different family sizes and configurations - 800 sq ft, 1000 sq ft, and 1200 sq ft versions]\n\nTypical dimensions for a small family house:\n• Total area: 800-1200 square feet\n• Living pavilion: 250-350 sq ft with 10-12 ft ceilings\n• Bedroom pavilions: 120-180 sq ft each (two bedrooms typical)\n• Kitchen: 100-150 sq ft\n• Courtyard: 300-400 sq ft (open air)\n• Circulation/transitions: 50-100 sq ft\n\nThe pavilion arrangement creates what Alexander calls 'positive outdoor space'—the courtyard feels like a room, bounded by building edges that create visual and acoustic enclosure.\n\nCross-references:\nPattern 61: Small Public Squares (similar principle of creating outdoor gathering space)\nPattern 75: The Family (establishes need for family-scale housing)\nPattern 77-81: Shelter and privacy gradients\nPattern 103: Forming a group of buildings\nPattern 106: Positive outdoor space\nPattern 154: Room layout considerations",
